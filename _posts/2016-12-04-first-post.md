I have wanted to do blogging for a while. The major purpose of this is to expose my everyday thoughts to both myself and the whole world (primarily to myself, since I figured the world won't and shouldn't care). 
I want to make myself more reflective of this life I am living. I am a big believer of **"what you cannot write down, word by word, you have not given a careful thought of"**.

Up util now, I have experienced stages of life from when I did not know the naiveness of my thoughts and eager to express myself to when I became more careful a person of not exposing my naiveness and prejudice and back to a stage when I finally became shameless. Partly because I knew people don't care or realized there is seldomly an opinion that is agreeable to everyone.

Blogging also serves a purpose of practicing my own writing and force myself to "create" than merely to "follow". Writing is quite a different brain exercise from reading or watching. Up until now, I finally started to develop a strong sense of urgency to train my creative thinking as much as what I have had for the importance of acquiring knowledge in the past ten years. Writing forces me to think more of my life. Letting the world see it forced me to think logically and try not to "lose face" (in case someone might read it eventually, which though is not likely).

As a scholar (at least if I have aimed to be one), the quality of writing is also vital to the job. I am not a native English speaker. Nor am I any talented at writing or conversation. So I suppose it I need to work on this.

So what will be the content of my blog? Is it going to be very technical? Probably not. I have written enough academic papers. But I will still make an effort to write things novel and try to use my own brain (though inevitably influenced by my background as well as the life I am living). I do have an expectation some of my writing turned out to be of bad quality. So I do not expect people to read this blog, unless he/she wants to know more about me or I by any chance get better. So the content would be in majority about my life in academia and my opinion on news and other people's life. 

I am also a believer that language proficiency can help people think. I will discuss this in more detail in the future perhaps.

Lastly, I don't know whether I can keep up doing it. But I am not worried.
